Chorus 1

I'm caught up in Your presence
I just want to sit here at Your feet

I'm caught up in this holy moment
I never want to leave

Oh, I'm not here for blessings
Jesus, You don't owe me anything

More than anything that You can do
I just want You

Verse 1

I'm sorry when I've just gone through the motions
I'm sorry when I just sang another song

Take me back to where we started
I open up my heart to You

Verse 2

I'm sorry when I've come with my agenda
I'm sorry when I forgot that You're enough

Take me back to where we started
I open up my heart to You

Bridge 1

I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else

Nothing else will do

we just want You
Nothing else, nothing else

Nothing else will do
