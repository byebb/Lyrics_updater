Verse 1

Underneath the stars I'll meet you
Underneath the stars I'll greet you

There beneath the stars I'll leave you
Before you go of your own free will

Verse 2

Underneath the stars you met me
Underneath the stars you left me

I wonder if the stars regret me
They come and go of their own free will

Verse 3

Here beneath the stars I'm mending
I'm here beneath the stars not ending

Why on earth am I pretending?
I'm here again, the stars befriending

They come and go of their own free will

Verse 4

Underneath the stars you met me
And here beneath the stars you left me

I wonder if the stars regret me
I'm sure they'd like me if they only met me

They come and go of their own free will
