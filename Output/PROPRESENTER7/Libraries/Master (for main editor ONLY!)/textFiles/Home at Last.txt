Verse 1

Who is there at the end of lonesome roads
All of us hope theres a home

A place to rest where wounds get dressed the tables full
The sound of laughter in the halls

Chorus 1

Light the fire gather round
Join together sing it loud

Raise the glass and joyful be
Home at last one family

Verse 2

Were all orphans looking for an open door
Hard times come no more

Come on up to the house of the Lord
Father adopts us all
