Verse 1

If faith can move the mountains
Let the mountains move

We come with expectation
Waiting here for You

Verse 2

Youre the Lord of all creation
And still You know my heart

The Author of Salvation
Youve loved me from the start

Verse 3

You are everything Youve promised
Your faithfulness is true

And we're desperate for Your presence
All we need is You

Chorus 1

Waiting here for You
With our hands lifted high in praise

And it's You we adore
