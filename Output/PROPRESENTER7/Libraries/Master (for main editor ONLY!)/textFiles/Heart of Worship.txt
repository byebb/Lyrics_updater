Verse 1

When the music fades
All is stripped away

And I simply come
Longin' just to bring

Something that's of worth
That will bless Your heart

Prechorus 1

I'll bring You more than a song

For a song in itself
Is not what You have required

You search much deeper within
Through the ways things appear

You're looking into my heart

Chorus 1

I'm comin' back to the heart of worship
And it's all about You

It's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
When it's all about You

It's all about You, Jesus

Verse 2

King of endless worth
No one could express

How much You deserve

Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is Yours

Every single breath
