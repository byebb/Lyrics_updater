Verse 1

I can see clearly now
That the rain is gone

I can see all
Obstacles in my way,

Gone are the dark clouds
That used to make me blind 

Chorus 1

It's gonna be a bright 
Bright sunshiny day 

It's gonna be a bright 
Bright sunshiny day 

Verse 2

I think I can make it now
That the rain is gone,

All of the bad
Feelings have disappeared

There is the rainbow
That l've been praying for 

Bridge 1

Look all around you, 
There is nothing but blue skies 

Look straight ahead, 
There's nothing but blue skies
