Verse 1

There's nothing worth more
that will ever come close

No thing can compare
You're our living hope

Your Presence

Verse 2

I've tasted and seen
of the sweetest of Loves

Where my heart becomes free
and my shame is undone

In Your Presence

Chorus 1

Holy Spirit You are welcome here
Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere

Your Glory God is what our hearts long for 
To be overcome by Your Presence Lord

Bridge 1

Let us become more aware of Your Presence

Let us experience the Glory of Your Goodness
