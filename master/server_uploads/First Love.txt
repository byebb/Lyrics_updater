Verse 1

This is all I want
That the love I have for You

Doesn't fade along with youth
Can You help with that

The reason that I ask
I've seen far too many friends

Walk away and not come back
I want more than that

Prechorus 1

I won't wash away

Like branches in rain

I'd rather be kindling in the light

Chorus 1

Set me on fire like I've never known
I want to love You more as life goes on

So all of my days I'll place
My first love first again

Verse 2

This is all I pray
Over everything I ask

That my friends one day come back
Can You help with that

God I know You can
Cause the fire won't mean a thing

If it ends right here with me
You want more than that

Prechorus 2

The river runs fast

But You wait at the banks

And pull us like driftwood from the wild

Chorus 2

So set me on fire like I've never known
I want to love You more as life goes on

So all of my days I'll place
My first love first again

Once I was drifting but You called me home
So I'll give my life for the ones still lost

And I'll see my friends reclaim
Their first love first again

Chorus 3

So set me on fire like I've never known
I want to love You more as life goes on

And all of my days I'll place
My first love first again

Once I was drifting but You called me home
So I'll give my life for the ones still lost

And I'll see my friends reclaim
Their first love first again

Tag 1

You'll see this world return
And Your first love love You first
