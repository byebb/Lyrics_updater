Verse 1

This is for the busted hearts
This is for the question marks

This is for the outcast soul
Lost control no one knows

Sing it for the cant go back
Sing it for the broken past

Sing it for the just found out
Life is now upside down

Prechorus 1

If youre lookin for hope tonight
Raise your hand

If you feelin alone 
And dont understaad

If youre fightin in the fight of your life
Then stand

Were gonna make it through this 
Hand in hand

Chorus 1

And if we fall we will fall together
Together

Verse 2

Ooh this is for the second chance
This is for the new romance

Sing it for the loved in vain
Overcame it's not too late 

Chorus 2

And if we fall we will fall together
Together

Oh and when we rise we will rise together
Together oh

Bridge 1

If youre lookin for hope tonight 
If youre feelin alone tonight 

If youre in the fight of your life
Were gonna make it happen yeah

I will be by your side 
Cause love is in the air tonight 

All up and see the light 

Whenever ever ever
Just as long as were together say

Together we are dangerous

Together with our differences

Together we are bolder braver stronger
