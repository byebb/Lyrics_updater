Verse 1

I close my eyes
And I can see

A world that's waiting up for me
That I call my home

Through the dark
Through the door

Through where no one's been before
But if feels like home

Prechorus 1

They can say
They can say it all sounds crazy

They can say
They can say I've lost my mind

I don't care
I don't care, so, call me crazy

We can live in a world that we design

Chorus 1

Cause every night I lie in bed
The brightest colours fill my head

A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be

A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take

Oh, a million dreams of the world we are gonna make

Verse 2

There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled

With things from far away
Special things I compile

Each one there to make you smile
On a rainy day

Prechorus 2

They can say
They can say it all sounds crazy

They can say
They can say we've lost our minds

I don't care
I don't care, if they call us crazy

Run away to a world that we design

Bridge 1

However big
However small

Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me

You may be right
You may be wrong

But say that you'll bring me along
To the world you see

To the world I close my eyes to see
I close my eyes to see

Chorus 2

Every night I lie in bed
The brightest colours fill my head

A million dreams are keeping me awake
A million dreams, A million dreams

I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see

A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make
