Verse 1

I'm living in a grace where
Everything is more than I imagined

Where what is undeserved is freely given

All my regrets and my failures

All of my wrongs have been left at the cross
Now all that remains is the Father's love

Chorus 1

You take me as I am

Over and over
You call me Yours again

You see it all
still You want me

How You love me
How You love me

Your kindness and mercy remind me

How You love me
How You love me

As I am

Verse 2

So let us be together
Seated at Your table in communion

Oh, everyone is equal in Your presence

Cause where I am from or where I've been

The way that I've lived or the colour of skin

Nothing will change how the Father loves me

Bridge 1

'Cause all my regrets and my failures
All of my wrongs have been left at the cross

Now all that remains is the Father's love

Postchorus 1

'Cause oh Lord, You take
Oh Lord, You take me

Take me as I am

Oh Lord, You take
Oh Lord, You take me

Take me as I am
