Verse 1

Worthy of every song we could ever sing
Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring

Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for You, oh, we live for You

Verse 2

Jesus, the Name above every other name
Jesus, the only One who could ever save

Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
We live for You, we live for You

Chorus 1

Holy, there is no one like You
There is none beside You

Open up my eyes in wonder

And show me who You are
And fill me with Your heart

And lead me in Your love to those around me

Verse 3

Jesus, the Name above every other name
Jesus, the only One who could ever save

Bridge 1

And I will build my life upon Your love
It is a firm foundation

And I will put my trust in You alone
And I will not be shaken
