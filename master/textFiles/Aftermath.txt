Verse 1

The skies lay low where You are

On the earth You rest Your feet

Yet the hands that cradle the stars

Are the hands that bled for me

Chorus 1

In a moment 
Of glorious surrender

You were broken 
For all the world to see

Lifted out of the ashes
I am found in the aftermath

Verse 2

Freedom found in Your scars

In Your grace my life redeemed

For You chose to take the sinner's crown

As You placed Your crown on me

Chorus 2

In that moment
Of glorious surrender

Was the moment 
You broke the chains in me

Lifted out of the ashes 
I am found in the aftermath

Chorus 3

And in that moment 
You opened up the heavens

To the broken the beggar and the thief

Lifted out the wreckage
I find hope in the aftermath

Bridge 1

And I know that You're with me

Yes I know that You're with me here

And I know Your love will light the way

Chorus 4

Now all I have I count it all as loss

But to know You and to carry the cross

Knowing I'm found
In the light of the aftermath
