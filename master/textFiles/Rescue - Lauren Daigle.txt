Verse 1

You are not hidden

There's never been a moment
You were forgotten

You are not hopeless

Though you have been broken
Your innocence stolen

Prechorus 1

I hear you whisper underneath your breath

I hear your SOS your SOS

Chorus 1

I will send out an army to find you
In the middle of the darkest night

It's true I will rescue you

Verse 2

There is no distance

That cannot be covered
Over and over

You're not defenseless

I'll be your shelter
I'll be your armor

Chorus 2

I will never stop marching to reach you
In the middle of the hardest fight

It's true I will rescue you

Prechorus 2

I hear the whisper underneath your breath

I hear you whisper you have nothing left

Tag 1

Oh I will rescue you
