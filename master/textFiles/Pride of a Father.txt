Verse 1

I could run a thousand miles
To win the race of life

But what's the value
Without You

I could write a thousand psalms
To captivate Your heart

But more than offerings
Lord You seek the depths of me

Chorus 1

When You see me
You see my heart

Through the eyes of Your mercy
In the light of Your Son

You love me
With open arms

And the pride of a father

Verse 2

I was once a prodigal
Burdened by my shame

Till You came running
To remind me

Your love is unconditional
And in Your eyes I'm worthy of

Forgiveness
What was lost is now redeemed

Bridge 1

Who am I that You love me
Who am I that You saved my soul

Who am I without You Lord

Who am I to be worthy
Who am I that You're mindful of me

Who am I that You call me Yours
