Verse 1

Wandering into the night
Wanting a place to hide

This weary soul
This bag of bones

And I try with all my might
But I just can't win the fight

I'm slowly drifting
A vagabond

Prechorus 1

And just when I ran out of road
I met a man I didn't know

And He told me that I was not alone

Chorus 1

He picked me up, He turned me around
He placed my feet on solid ground

I thank the Master, 
I thank the Savior

Because He healed my heart, He changed my name
Forever free, I'm not the same

I thank the Master, 
I thank the Savior

I thank God

Tag 1

Oh I thank God

Verse 2

I cannot deny what I see
Got no choice but to believe

My doubts are burning
Like ashes in the wind

So, so long to my old friends
Burden and bitterness

You can just keep it moving
Nah, you ain't welcome here

Bridge 1

Hell lost another one, 
I am free, I am free, I am free

Bridge 2

Get up, get up, get up
Get up outta that grave
