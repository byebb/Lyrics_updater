Chorus 1

Silent night holy night
All is calm all is bright

Round yon virgin
Mother and child

Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace

Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight

Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly host sing hallelujah

Christ the Saviour is born
Christ the Saviour is born

I love You Lord I worship You
Hope which was lost now stands renewed

I give my life to honour this
The love of Christ the Saviour King

Silent night holy night
Son of God love's pure light

Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace

Jesus Lord at Thy birth
Jesus Lord at Thy birth
