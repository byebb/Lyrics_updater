Verse 1

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go

Take a look at the five and ten, it's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes that glow

Verse 2

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store

But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Chorus 1

A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish for Barney and Ben

Dolls that'll talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen

And Mom and Dad can hardly wait
For school to start again.

Verse 3

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go

There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.

Verse 4

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start

And the thing that will make 'em ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Verse 5

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go

There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.

Verse 6

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start

And the thing that will make 'em ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Verse 7

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store

But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
