Verse 1

The First Noel the angels did say

Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay

In fields where they
Lay keeping their sheep

On a cold winter's night
That was so deep

Verse 2

They looked up and saw a star

Shining in the east beyond them far

And to the earth it gave great light

And so it continued both day and night
