Verse 1

You are my ecosystem
You are the air I'm breathing

In the endless wasteland
You are my rushing fountain

Verse 2

You are my ecosystem
No matter what the weather

You are my better option
No matter what I'm facing

Chorus 1

You are water from the rock,
and I'll thirst no more

You hold up my arms
when I'm battle-torn

Oasis within me
You're the oasis within me

You are colors in the sky
after forty rains

In the thick of the night
You're the break of day

Oasis within me
You're the oasis within me

Verse 3

You are the thing I've needed
In each and every season

And I really mean it
Yeah, I really mean it

Bridge 1

Storm or drought
Surrounded by fire or flood

With You
I'm never without

So if I go or stay
I know that it's all the same

It's You
You are my escape
