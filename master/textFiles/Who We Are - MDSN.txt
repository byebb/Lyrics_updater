Verse 1

We are royalty

God created us
Fearfully and wonderfully

We are breathed from dust
His kingdom is our destiny

We are born to be
More than conquerors

We're ambassadors of heaven
For a broken earth

We are carrying the cure
To counteract the curse

It's His love in us

Chorus 1

We make no apologies
For dreaming wild and living free

Faith is in the air we breathe
This is who we are

No impossibilities
Miracles come naturally

Jesus is our everything

This is who we are
This is who we are

Verse 2

No anxiety

Has a place in us
We rest in all-surpassing peace

We are called to lift the culture
Out of sin's debris

Won't live silently

Bridge 1

Got a new identity
Love is our legacy

Hearts with no vacancy
Jesus lives in us

Got a new identity
Love is our legacy

Hearts with no vacancy
Jesus
