Verse 1

Joy to the world the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King

Let every heart prepare Him room

And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and nature sing

And Heaven and Heaven and nature sing

Chorus 1

Joy to the world
Joy to the world

Verse 2

Joy to the World the Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ

While fields and floods rocks hills and plains

Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy

Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy
