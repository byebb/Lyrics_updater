Verse 1

I love You Lord,
Oh Your mercy never fails me

All my days,
I've been held in Your hands

From the moment that I wake up,
Until I lay my head

I will sing,
Of the goodness of God

Chorus 1

All my life you have been faithful
All my life you have been so, so good

With every breath that I am able
I will sing of the goodness of God

Tag 1

I will sing of the goodness of God

Verse 2

I love your voice,
You have led me through the fire

In darkest nights,
You are close like no other

I've known you as a father,
I've known you as a friend

I have lived,
In the godness of God

Bridge 1

Your goodness is running after,
It's running after me

Your goodness is running after,
It's running after me

With my life laid down, I'm surrendered now,
I give you everything

Your goodness is running after,
It's running after me
