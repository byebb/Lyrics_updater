Verse 1

The angels bow down at the thought of You
The darkness gives way to the light for You

The price that You paid gives us life brand new

Hosanna forever we worship You
Hosanna forever we worship You

Verse 2

For You are the joy that my soul longs for
The Lamb that was slain for my sins

And the One I adore
King of kings Ruler of everything

Hosanna forever we worship You
Hosanna forever we worship You

Prechorus 1

For Your patience and kindness
And favor and mercy

And honor and glory
Because You are worthy

We can't live without You
We can't breathe without You

We can't sing without You
Hosanna hosanna

No greater love in this world but You
No one can compare to the things You do

Wherever You go I will follow You

Hosanna forever we worship You
Hosanna forever we worship You

Chorus 2

Someday every tongue shall confess Your name
This house made of clay soon shall pass away

And whatever the test You will bring us through

Hosanna forever we worship You
Hosanna forever we worship You
