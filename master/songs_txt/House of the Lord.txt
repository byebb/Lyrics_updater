Chorus 1

I spin my records on a Sunday
Before I get myself to church

I put on my best fit
Your song got me dancing

I cannot wait to get out the door
We're going to the house of the Lord

Verse 1

God through every season
You give me a reason

To see beyond my mistakes
And wash away my old ways

Prechorus 1

Now I'm a living
Testimony of Your grace

God You give me
Purpose for a brand new day

Verse 2

See on the first day I made mistakes
And on the second day I lost my way

But on the third day I found Your grace
And ever since then ain't been the same

Ain't been the same
Ain't been the same

See I opened up the Word
And everything started changing

Since the beginning when I was running
I was on Your mind despite the life I was living

Tag 1

We're going to the house of the Lord

Postchorus 1

I'm gonna run to the sanctuary
I'm gonna go where You set me free

Once I was blind but now I see
So let all the redeemed sing

Tag 2

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah Lord
