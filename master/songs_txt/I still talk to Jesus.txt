Verse 1

If there's a heaven
I hope that I get in, but I probably won't

I break all the rules
Do all the things the Bible says, "Don't"

Prechorus 1

I don't change my ways, I don't change my shirt
I go from the club straight to the church

It's the same prayer, it's the same hurt

Chorus 1

Maybe I drink too much
Fall in and out of love

There's been a couple times
I've done a couple lines

I lie to my mama, I smoke marijuana
Most of the time I do what I wanna

You might not believe it
But I still talk to Jesus

Verse 2

I've got a past more stained than the glass
Everyone knows

I need salvation for my reputation
So here it goes

Bridge 1

Hallelujah, Amazing Grace
Just tryna do better than yesterday

Hallelujah, Amazing Grace
Just tryna do better than yesterday

Tag 1

I know that I need it
So, I still talk to Jesus
