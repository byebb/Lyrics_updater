Verse 1

In the Saviour's love
I find joy beyond compare 

Endless peace covers all of me

When You breathe within
You turn winter into spring

Verse 2

Grace dissolves every fear in me
Your love brings me to my knees 

Brings me to my knees
My King forever

You are all my heart desires 
Until the end of time

Chorus 1

My soul surrendered
In my vacant heart

Lord You came and made a home 

You bring light to the dark in me
When I lose my way

I am beckoned into grace 

Bridge 1

You alone are my everything

All the earth sing of mercy never ending 
I will worship with all that is within me 

Holy holy Lord God Almighty

King of heaven
Yours is the glory
