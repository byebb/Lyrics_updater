Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Verse 1

Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said

Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Chorus 1

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new king born today

And man shall live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Verse 2

Our shepherds watch their flocks by night
They saw a bright new shining star

They heard a choir sing a song,
The music seemed to come from afar

Verse 3

Now Joseph and his wife, Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night

They found no place to bear her child,
Not a single room was in sight

Bridge 1

And then they found a little nook
In a stable all forlorn,

And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little boy was born
