Verse 1

I found a love, for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead

Well, I found a man, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

Verse 2

Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was

I will not give you up this time

Darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own

And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Chorus 1

Baby, Im dancing in the dark
With you between my arms

Barefoot on the grass

Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess

I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it

Darling, you look perfect tonight

Verse 3

Well, I found a man, stronger than anyone I know

He shares my dreams, 
I hope that someday I'll share his home

I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

Verse 4

Cause we are still kids
But we're so in love

Fighting against all odds
I know well be alright this time

Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, youll be your man

I see my future in your eyes

Chorus 2

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms

Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song

I have faith in what I see

Now I know I have met an angel in person
And he looks perfect

Tag 1

I dont deserve this
You look perfect tonight
