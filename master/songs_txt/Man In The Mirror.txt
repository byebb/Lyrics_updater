I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life

It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference

Gonna make it right

Verse 1

As I turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat

This wind is blowin' my mind 

I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat

Who am I to be blind
Pretending not to see their needs

Prechorus 1

A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top

And a one man's soul

They follow each other
On the wind ya know

'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

Chorus 1

I'm starting with the man in the mirror

I'm asking him to change his ways

And no message could have been any clearer

If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Na na na, na na na, na na na na

Verse 2

I've been a victim of
A selfish kind of love

It's time that I realize

There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan

Could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone

Prechorus 2

A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart

And a washed-out dream

They follow the pattern
Of the wind you see

'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

Chorus 2

I'm starting with the man in the mirror

I'm asking him to change his ways

And no message could have been any clearer

If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Chorus 3

I'm starting with the man in the mirror

I'm asking him to change his ways

And no message could have been any clearer

If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a - change

Chorus 4

I'm starting with the man in the mirror

I'm asking him to change his ways

And no message could have been any clearer

If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
