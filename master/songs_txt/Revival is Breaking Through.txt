Verse 1

God I see your people

Walking in the rhythm
Of this world

Searching for peace
Only you can give

Chorus 1

You prepare the way
And we will walk in faith

We are ready for the new
So do what you can do

Verse 2

Oh it feels
Like weâ€™re in the dessert

Thirsty for the living hope

God let your peace rain
On us we pray

We pray

Chorus 2

Let your spirit fall on us
Let us understand your heart

We will see what you can do
Revival is breaking through
