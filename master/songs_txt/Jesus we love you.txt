Chorus 1

Jesus we love you
Oh how we love you

You are the one our hearts adore

Prechorus 1

Old things have passed away
Your love has stayed the same

Your constant grace remains the cornerstone

Things that we thought were dead
Are breathing in life again

You cause your Son to shine on darkest nights

Bridge 1

Our affection, our devotion
Poured out on the feet of Jesus

Our affection, our devotion
Poured out on the feet of Jesus
