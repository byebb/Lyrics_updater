Verse 1

It's the most wonderful time of the year

With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you be of good cheer

It's the most wonderful time of the year

It's the hap-happiest season of all

With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings
When friends come to call

It's the hap-happiest season of all

There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting

And caroling out in the snow

There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories of

Christmases long, long ago

It's the most wonderful time of the year

There'll be much mistltoeing
And hearts will be glowing

When loved ones are near
