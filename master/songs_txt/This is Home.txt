Verse 1

I've got my memories
They're always inside of me

But I can't go back
Back to how it was

I believe in now
I've come too far

Now I can't go back
Back to how it was

Created for a place
I've never known

Chorus 1

This is home
Now I'm finally

Where I belong
Where I belong

Yeah, this is home
I've been searching

For a place of my own
Now I've found it

Maybe this is home
Yeah, this is home

Verse 2

Belief over misery
I've seen the enemy

And I won't go back
Back to how it was

And I got my heart set on
What happens next

I got my eyes wide
It's not over yet

We are miracles
And we're not alone

Bridge 1

And now
After all my searching

After all my questions
I'm gonna call it home

I got a brand new mindset
I can finally see the sunset

I'm gonna call it home

Tag 1

I've come too far
And I won't go back

Yeah, this is home
