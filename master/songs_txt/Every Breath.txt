Verse 1

I'm pulling on joy from Heaven's reserve

He's stored up enough, for every winter I'm served

I'm seeing beyond my circumstance
This joy that I have is my Inheritance

Joy, this is the joy of the Lord

Chorus 1

The joy, the joy
The joy of the Lord is my strength

The joy, oh, the joy
The joy of the Lord is my strength

Oh-oh-oh, 
He is my hope

The joy, the joy
The joy of the Lord is my strength

Verse 2

There is a Savior in the valley place
He's walking beside me and He knows my pain

God, the beginning and the end
God, right there in the midst of it

Joy, this is the Joy of the Lord
Oh, joy, this is the joy of the Lord

Bridge 1

There's gonna be glory
There's gonna be glory

There will be glory after this

No need to worry
In this present suffering

There will be glory after this

Bridge 2

There is a King seated on His throne
Prepared a place that I'll call my home

And there I will see Him face to face
He'll wipe every tear from my face

Joy, this is the Joy of the Lord
Oh, I'm talking about joy

This is the joy of the Lord-all
Oh, I'm talking about joy

This is the joy of the Lord
Oh, sing it from the hilltop

Joy (Oh joy), this is the joy of the Lord
