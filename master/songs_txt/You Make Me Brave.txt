Verse 1

I stand before You now

The greatness of your renown

I have heard of the majesty
and wonder of you

King of Heaven, in humility, I bow

Chorus 1

As Your love
In wave after wave

Crashes over me
Crashes over me

For You are for us
You are not against us

Champion of Heaven
You made a way for all to enter in

Verse 2

I have heard You calling my name

I have heard the song of love that You sing

So I will let You draw me out
beyond the shore

Into Your grace
Your grace

Bridge 1

You make me brave
You make me brave

You call me out beyond
The shore into the waves

You make me brave
You make me brave

No fear can hinder
Now the love that made a way

Bridge 2

You make me brave
You make me brave

You call me out beyond
The shore into the waves

You make me brave
You make me brave

No fear can hinder
Now the promise You've made
